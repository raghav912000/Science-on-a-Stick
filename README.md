# Science-on-a-Stick
The thought of this project came when I was working in my physics lab. I made this project to overcome the limitations of performing experiments using conventional apparatus. Through this project, we can verify the value of acceleration due to gravity, Faraday's  Law and Lenz's Law with more accuracy and fewer efforts.  I use Arduino to convert analog value ( voltage across a coil) into digital values and send it to the laptop. I write a python code which receives data send by Arduino and plot the corresponding analog value. Through this curve, we can easily observe the maximum voltage across a coil. We can also verify Lenz's Law by the sinusoidal nature of the curve. I also use hall switch to give an interrupt to Arduino when a magnet passes it. By these interrupts, I can measure the time between any two points with more accuracy.
